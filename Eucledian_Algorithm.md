###Basic Euclidean Algorithm for GCD 
The algorithm is based on the below facts. 

If we subtract a smaller number from a larger (we reduce a larger number), GCD doesnâ€™t change.
So if we keep subtracting repeatedly the larger of two, we end up with GCD.Now instead of
subtraction, if we divide the smaller number, the algorithm stops when we find remainder 0
