## BIT POINTS 
- if a>>1 than it is divided by 2 
- if a<<1 than it is multiplied by 2 
- if you & any number with 1 than  if output is 1 than it is 1 and if output is 0 than it is even 
- SWAPPING 
``` a = a^b
     b = a^b
     a = a^b
 ```
 - if you xor a to a than ouput is 0 and of a xor with 0 than its output is a
